🎟 Ticket Booking System

A simple Java-based Ticket Booking System designed to manage reservations efficiently. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, methods, and basic file handling for data persistence.

✅ Features

User Registration & Login

Create new user accounts.

Login with credentials.

Book Tickets

Select events/shows.

Specify seat category and number of tickets.

Get a booking confirmation.

View Available Seats

Check real-time seat availability.

Cancel Tickets

Cancel previously booked tickets.

Simple & Interactive Console UI

Easy to navigate and use.

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Java (Core Java)

Concepts Used:

Object-Oriented Programming

Collections (ArrayList, HashMap)

Exception Handling

File Handling (if implemented for storing data)

▶ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ASHWANIKY2308/Ticket_booking_System.git


Open in an IDE:

Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE.

Compile the Java files:

javac Main.java


Run the project:

java Main

🔍 How It Works

The Main.java file serves as the entry point and displays the menu options.

User.java handles user details like name, email, and login.

Ticket.java stores ticket-related details (seat number, price, event name).

BookingSystem.java contains the logic for:

Booking a ticket

Canceling a ticket

Checking availability

Data is stored either in memory (via ArrayList/HashMap) or file storage for persistence.

💡 Future Enhancements

Add GUI using JavaFX or Swing.

Implement Database (MySQL) for storing user and ticket data.

Add Payment Gateway Simulation for booking confirmation.



Do you want me to also write a short summary for the GitHub repo description (the one-line tagline under the repo name)? Or should I also prepare screenshots and a demo GIF section for your README to make it visually attractive?
